Claim Processing and Resubmission Eligibility System
A Python-based system for processing healthcare claims from multiple EMR sources and determining resubmission eligibility for denied claims. This system analyzes denied claims, classifies denial reasons, and identifies which claims can be resubmitted for reimbursement.

Features
Multi-Source Processing: Handles claims from different EMR systems (CSV and JSON formats)

Intelligent Denial Classification: Categorizes denial reasons as retryable, non-retryable, or ambiguous

Resubmission Eligibility: Determines which denied claims qualify for resubmission based on multiple criteria

Data Normalization: Standardizes dates, reasons, and claim data across different source formats

Comprehensive Logging: Detailed logging for processing metrics and error tracking

Automated Recommendations: Generates specific resubmission recommendations based on denial types

Supported Data Sources
EMR Alpha: CSV format with specific column structure

EMR Beta: JSON format with different field naming conventions

Eligibility Criteria
The system evaluates claims based on multiple factors to determine resubmission eligibility:

Claim must have "denied" status

Patient ID must be present

Claim must have been submitted more than 7 days ago

Denial reason must be classified as retryable

Ambiguous cases are evaluated using a mock LLM classifier

Denial Reason Classification
Retryable Reasons
Missing modifier

Incorrect NPI

Prior auth required

Incorrect procedure code

Non-Retryable Reasons
Authorization expired

Incorrect provider type

Not covered services

Invalid billing information

Installation
Ensure Python 3.7+ is installed

Install required dependencies: pandas

Clone or download the processing script

Usage
Basic Execution
Run the script directly to process sample data included in the code:

bash
python claim_processor.py
Custom Data Processing
To process your own EMR data:

Prepare your data files in the expected formats

Modify the file paths in the main execution section

Adjust the current date parameter if needed

Output Files
The system generates two output files:

resubmission_candidates.json: Claims eligible for resubmission with specific recommendations

rejected_records.json: Records that failed processing with error details

Configuration
Adjust current_date parameter for different processing timelines

Modify RETRYABLE_REASONS and NON_RETRYABLE_REASONS sets for custom denial reason handling

Update date parsing logic for different date formats in source systems

Processing Logic
Data Loading: Reads and parses source files

Normalization: Standardizes dates, reasons, and field names across systems

Classification: Categorizes denial reasons and determines eligibility

Recommendation: Generates specific resubmission instructions

Output: Saves results and maintains error logs

Error Handling
Invalid dates are logged and excluded from processing

Missing required fields flag claims as ineligible

Malformed records are captured in rejected records with error details

Comprehensive logging throughout the processing pipeline

Customization
The system can be extended to:

Support additional EMR source formats

Integrate with actual LLM APIs for ambiguous case resolution

Add custom denial reason classifications

Connect to database systems for persistent storage

Implement email notifications for resubmission candidates

Dependencies
pandas: For data manipulation and CSV processing

Standard Python libraries: json, logging, datetime, re, typing

Important Notes
This is a demonstration system with sample data generation

Actual production use would require proper healthcare data compliance measures (HIPAA)

Date logic uses current system date by default

Always validate results before actual claim resubmission

Use Cases
Healthcare revenue cycle management

Claims denial analysis and reporting

Automated resubmission identification

EMR system integration projects

Healthcare billing optimization
